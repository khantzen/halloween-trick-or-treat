Halloween Trick or Treat
------------------------

Halloween is coming, and many children are in front of your house. They are shouting: "trick or treat!" So you need to give them some candy, let them leave.

- Arguments:
  - children: numbers of children, more than or equals to 2
  - candies: packets of items, like this:
```
[["candy","apple","candy"],["candy","candy"],["candy","candy"]]
```
- Results:
  - If the children get what they want, return "Thank you, strange uncle!"
  - If not, return "Trick or treat!"

- How to let the children satisfied ?
  1. Each child has at least two candies;
  2. Each child gets the same amount of candy.
  3. No children get the "bomb" ;-)
  4. Packets cannot be divided, each child gets a full packet
